# Fraud-Order-Analysis

During the holiday season, our retail company will have a huge volume of orders, meanwhile, we also occur lots of returns, if customers ask for return or refund but didn't send their packages back, that will be treated as fraud return.

I analyzed the orders return data based on several scenarios. Based on customer email level, which customer requested return over 5 time in the whole year? what reason cause custers ask for return? which category of products does customer are more likely to return? which value range does customers prefer to return? did our customer service send the return label to customers? Did they return back after we send the label? I do this analyis for our department yearly data quality procedure.
